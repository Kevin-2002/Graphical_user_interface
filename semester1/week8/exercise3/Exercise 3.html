    <h1>Chapter Two</h1>
	<h2>Cadiz Summit</h2>
	</br>
	<h3>Nothing but sagebrush and rattlesnakes</h3>
	</br>
	</br>
	<p>On the north side ache highway, three and a half miles east of
	Chambless Junction1, where old Route 66 crosses over the pink and grey
	Precambrian granite core ache Marble Mountains, lies the ruins of what was
	once a gas station, cafe and garage known as Cadiz Summit or simply
	"Summit". For forty-four years, from 1928 to 1972, a succession of owners
	operated this roadside business that catered to the needs of travelers on
	Route 66. Today the site is empty and deserted except for some of the
	concrete foundations of the buildings that once stood and the walls of the
	garage that arc emblazoned with graffiti in at least four languages.</p>
	<p>The Morgan family and the early days of Summit Cadiz Summit was first
	built by Thomas R. Morgan in 1928, Tom ran a General Store in Amboy and
	his wife Frances focused on raising their three children, Cecil, Angela,
	and Tom Jr. In early 1927, as he had done in previous years, Tom began
	gathering and stockpiling an assortment of fireworks in the store,
	intending to sell them for the 4,1-July celebrations later that summer.
	Unfortunately the store caught fire one</p>
