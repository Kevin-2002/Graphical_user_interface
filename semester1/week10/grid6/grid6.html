										While the modern concept of a grid layout has been with us since the Industrial Revolution, grids
										have been a design tool for centuries. As such, it shouldn’t come as a shock that grid-based
										layouts have been a goal of CSS since the beginning. According to Dr. Bert Bos, who co-created
										CSS with Håkon Wium Lie, grid-based layouts have actually been on his mind for quite some time.
										“CSS started as something very simple,” Bos recalled. “It was just a way to create a view of a
										document on a very simple small screen at the time. Twenty years ago, screens were very small.
										So, when we saw that we could make a style sheet for documents, we thought, Well, what else can
										we do now that we have a system for making style sheets?
